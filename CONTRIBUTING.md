### üîß Code Contributions

#### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes**: Fix existing issues
- **Features**: Implement new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **Refactoring**: Improve code structure without changing functionality

#### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if someone is already working on it
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Your Changes

We use conventional commits. Please format your commit messages as:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add device flow support"
git commit -m "fix(cli): handle missing config file gracefully"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Reference any related issues** (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- **Describe what you changed and why**
- **Include screenshots for UI changes**
- **Ensure all checks pass**

### 5. Code Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
- Address any feedback or requested changes
- Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Provide type annotations for function parameters and return types
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### File Organization

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli.ts              # Main CLI entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/           # Command implementations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Export all commands
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ login.ts        # Individual command files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/             # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Business logic services

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/          # Test files
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- crypto.test.ts
```

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  describe('method name', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = 'test';
      
      // Act
      const result = methodUnderTest(input);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });
  });
});
```
